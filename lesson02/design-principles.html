                elements. It is the space between the elements on your website page. White space organizes the website
                content by
                separating
                the elements as well as grouping them.</p>

            <p><p><span class="first-word">Description:</span>This website is a good example of visual hierarchy. Visual Heirarchy guides the reader's eyes
                across the page starting from the left and read horizontally to the right. This is where this website has
                the most important information. They are using the "Z" pattern to guide the viewer from top left to
                right and diagonally downward where they are able to enter their zip code. The colors are bright, and
                the most important elements are placed in order of importance.

            <p><p><span class="first-word">Description:</span> PARC stands for proximity, alignment , repetition and contrast.When we see this website
                we can see how they have used PARC. As we can see that the elements in the page are in close proximity.
                As for alignment every element
                in the page is has a visual conecction to another element. Repetition is done by indtoducing the color
                blue throught the website this will insure
                consistency. Contrast is used to create visual interest which is done well by the use of black and white
                font colors depending on the background color.
